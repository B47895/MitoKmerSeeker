# MitoKmerSeeker

This project is created for the Tartu University BSc thesis "Finding specific k-mers to identify animal species which cause food allergy" by Andrea JÃµesaar.
This repository exists purely for the purpose of having the program files and results available for review  by the committee and the opponent but will remain up after the defence.

This repository contains several folders:
* K-mers -- the final sets of k-mers for the 50 species of interest
* Programs -- all the programs created for the thesis, not including the neccessary programs that they depend on
* Additional files -- files which were also created for the thesis 

For additional information on the files, consult the README files inside the corresponding folders.
